  <h2>Dear Sirs,</h2>
  <p>I am writing this letter to express my profound and utmost dissatisfaction with the experience I have been having
    at the London KIA - ON dealership regarding my vehicle, a 2022 Kia Sorento SX with VIN# 5XYRKDLF6NG093438.</p>
  <p>First and foremost, I would like to emphasize that my intention with this letter is not to harm Kia's reputation,
    but rather to communicate serious issues I have been facing that need to be resolved as quickly as possible for me
    to regain my trust in the brand. I understand that many customers may not be bothered by similar problems, but I
    deeply care about the quality and performance of the vehicle I chose, and therefore, I expect, at the very least,
    attention and respectful treatment from the dealership.</p>

  <h2>Issues I Have Been Facing:</h2>
  <h3>1 - Steering Noise:</h3>
  <p>Since October 2022, I have reported the issue five times (10/19/2022, 10/28/2022, 02/17/2023, 04/13/2023, and
    10/31/2023), regarding an annoying noise in the steering area of my vehicle, along with difficulty in steering, as
    can be seen in the attached videos. Despite attempts to resolve the issue, it persists and has worsened over time.

  </div>

  <h3>2 - Dashboard Noise:</h3>
  <p>In addition to the steering problem, I have been experiencing an irritating noise on the vehicle's dashboard:</p>

  </audio>

  <h3>3 - Parking Sensor:</h3>
  <p>The parking sensor has been functioning incorrectly, compromising my safety and that of my family during driving.
    For example, when stopping behind another vehicle with a distance of more than 1 meter, the sensor does not
    activate, and randomly, after a certain period (approximately 15 seconds), the camera engages, and the sensor starts
    beeping in red/yellow, and sometimes green.</p>

  </div>

  <h3>4 - Unsatisfactory Customer Service:</h3>
  <p>I also want to highlight the inappropriate and disrespectful behaviour of the attendant <b>Glen Therrien</b>. When
    I reported the dashboard noise, he seemed to dismiss my concern, acting as if my complaint was a joke (smirking).
    Moreover, he mocked the fact that the vehicle might need to stay at the dealership for a long 30 days for repairs,
    which is unacceptable for any customer.</p>

  <h2>Current Situation:</h2>
  <p>Currently, my vehicle has been at your dealership for three days, and so far, no action has been taken to resolve
    the reported issues. This situation is unacceptable, and I cannot fathom the idea of continuing with a Kia vehicle,
    let alone trusting your dealership for future services, especially when my vehicle remains in exactly the same
    condition and position since the first day it was delivered to the dealership (moved from the check-in area to the
    outdoor lot; in front of the dealership). To my most unexpected surprise, I received a phone call today from
    technician Glen Therrien informing me that there is nothing that can be done to my vehicle because it does not have
    any issues. Allow me to clarify, I am not surprised by the technician's feedback at all, as the vehicle has remained
    immobilized and untouched for 3 days, as evidenced in the attached photos.</p>

  <h2>Resolution Request:</h2>
  <p>I hope that this complaint will be handled with the seriousness and professionalism it deserves and that the
    mentioned issues will be resolved. I await a prompt response, indicating the actions that will be taken to address
    the problems with my vehicle and to ensure more respectful and professional service from your team.</p>

  <p><strong>P.S.:</strong> I would like to emphasize that, due to the disrespectful treatment received from technician
    Glen Therrien, I NO LONGER wish to receive service or technical assistance from him. Therefore, I would like to be
    assisted by another professional from the dealership.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, I want to express my deepest frustration with the scheduling of services at the dealership. After all,
    what is the purpose of the scheduling service if, every time I have used it, I have taken the car to the dealership,
    and nothing has been done? This practice has been a source of great inconvenience and time loss for me. As a
    professional with work commitments and a busy schedule, I do not have the flexibility to keep going to the
    dealership in search of solutions to problems that should have been resolved a long time ago.</p>
